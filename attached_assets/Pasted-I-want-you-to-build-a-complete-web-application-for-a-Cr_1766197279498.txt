I want you to build a complete web application for a Creative Agency Management Platform. 

**Role:** Act as a Senior Python Full-Stack Developer.
**Goal:** Build a functional MVP that couples Sales (CRM) with Production (Project Management).

### 1. The Tech Stack (Replit Native)
- **Backend:** Python with Flask.
- **Database:** SQLite (using SQLAlchemy ORM) - Keep it simple for now, manageable in one file if possible or standard `models.py`.
- **Frontend:** Server-side rendered HTML (Jinja2).
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS + DaisyUI (imported via CDN). Do not set up a Node/NPM build step.
- **Interactivity:** HTMX (imported via CDN) for seamless updates (drag-and-drop, status changes).
- **Icons:** FontAwesome (via CDN).
- **Auth:** Flask-Login for simple user authentication.

### 2. Data Models (SQLAlchemy)
Please implement the following relationships:

1. **User**
   - `id`, `username`, `password_hash`, `role` (Admin or Photographer).

2. **Client**
   - `id`, `name`, `industry`, `email`, `phone`.

3. **Deal** (The Sales Opportunity)
   - `id`, `client_id` (ForeignKey), `title`, `value` (Float), `stage` (String: 'New', 'Proposal', 'Negotiation', 'Won', 'Lost'), `is_recurring` (Boolean - *Critical*), `notes` (Text).

4. **Job** (The Active Project)
   - `id`, `client_id` (ForeignKey), `deal_id` (ForeignKey), `status` (String: 'Active', 'Completed'), `start_date`, `is_retainer` (Boolean).

5. **Deliverable** (The Specific Task)
   - `id`, `job_id` (ForeignKey), `title` (e.g., "5 Photos"), `status` (String: 'To Do', 'Shooting', 'Editing', 'Review', 'Done'), `assignee_id` (ForeignKey to User), `due_date`.

### 3. Core Features & Business Logic

**A. Authentication**
- Create a simple Login page.
- Seed the database with one Admin user (user: `admin`, pass: `admin`) and two Photographers.

**B. The Deals Board (Sales CRM)**
- Route: `/deals`
- View: A Kanban board with columns for the stages.
- Logic: When a Deal is moved to "Won":
  - Automatically create a `Job` record linked to that Client.
  - If `is_recurring` is True, mark the Job as a Retainer.

**C. The Production Dashboard**
- Route: `/production`
- View: A list of active Jobs. 
- UI: Use DaisyUI Accordions. 
  - The "Header" of the accordion is the Client Name/Job Status.
  - When expanded, show a table of `Deliverables` associated with that job.

**D. Deliverable Management**
- Allow users to add Deliverables to a Job.
- Allow users to change the status of a Deliverable (e.g., from "Shooting" to "Editing") using a dropdown.

### 4. UI/Design Requirements
- Use a dark/modern theme (DaisyUI `dark` theme).
- Sidebar navigation: Links to Dashboard, Deals, Production, Logout.
- Use colorful badges for Statuses (e.g., Green for 'Won', Yellow for 'Negotiation').

### 5. Implementation Instructions
1. Setup the Flask app structure.
2. Create `models.py` with the schema above.
3. Create `routes.py` with the logic.
4. Create a `templates/` folder with `base.html` (including CDNs) and child templates for the pages.
5. Provide a script or route to initialize/seed the database with dummy data so I can test it immediately.

Start by setting up the file structure and the database models.
